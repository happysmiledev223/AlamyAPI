Tick box selection of images from Alamy API search with an automatic download into the shopify product store, 
bringing with it the keywords/ titles etc AND the image without any manual downloading and inputting



During the automatic download, image is reduced in size to load into shopify and removal of the Alamy watermark 
(I’ll speak to Alamy) and cover up or reseize/ trim the back strip at the bottom of the image. 
With amazed-monster-relieved.ngrok-free.app will this link always be available to us or 
will it become an app in our shopify store or do we need to host it somewhere – 
please advise accordingly. As this is a rolling project which we cannot see developments as they occur, 
I hope that if there are some additional small changes in the plan that you help us with implementing them 
while not increasing the costs.
